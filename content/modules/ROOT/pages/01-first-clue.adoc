That Nate guy. Somehow he’s gotten trapped in the machine.

How?

I don’t know, he went down to work on some guy named Flynn’s computer
and now here we are, he’s trapped in the machine.

Anywho, can you save him? Apparently he’s left clues around the machine
that you have to put together into some sort of message that he can then
pass to some sort of process on the machine to free him? I don’t know it
all sounds very complex and I’m far too manager-y to really understand.
It’s all just super annoying. He keeps sending me emails from within the
machine with the first thing he needs to be collected. Let me read what
he said:

Scott: I've left the first clue in the
/var/log/messages file.  You will need to
reconstitute it by isolating all the messages
from the nate application!
